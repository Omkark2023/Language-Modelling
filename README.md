Language Modelling

Overview

This project focuses on building and training a simple character-level language model using a dataset of Shakespeare's text. The model encodes characters into integers and uses PyTorch to train a neural network to predict the next character in a sequence. The model's goal is to learn the structure and style of Shakespearean text, which can then be used to generate similar text.

Dataset

The project uses the Tiny Shakespeare dataset, which is a small subset of Shakespeare's works, suitable for training character-level models.

The dataset can be downloaded directly from the following source:

!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt

Installation

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x

PyTorch

Jupyter Notebook

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required packages:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/LanguageModelling.git

cd LanguageModelling

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook NanoGpt.ipynb to explore the language model's implementation and training process.

Steps Included in the Notebook:


Data Loading:

Download and read the Tiny Shakespeare dataset.
View the first 500 characters of the dataset to understand its structure.
Character Mapping:


Extract unique characters from the dataset.
Create mappings from characters to integers and vice versa.
Data Encoding:


Encode the text data into integer sequences.


Prepare the data for training by splitting it into training and test sets.
Model Training:


Define and train the neural network model using PyTorch.


Use the trained model to predict the next character in a sequence.
Testing and Generation:


Test the model on unseen data.


Generate new text sequences based on the trained model.


Examples

To see how the model works, you can run the notebook and observe the text generated by the model after training. The generated text should resemble the style and structure of Shakespeare's work.
